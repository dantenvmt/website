## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to store the project, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dantenvmt/website.git](https://github.com/dantenvmt/website.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd website
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary packages for the project to run.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server**
    This will start the application on a local server.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Once it's running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application live. The page will automatically reload as you make changes to the code.
